## Test plans and test strategies  


## There is a common misconception that test plans and test strategies are the same and therefore the terms are interchangeable. This is untrue as the two documents are very different and have different purposes.  


It is not uncommon for some companies to include a test strategy inside the test plan and this is acceptable for small projects. However, for larger projects there is usually one test strategy document and a number of different test plans aimed at each phase or level of testing.  


## Test strategies  


Test strategies are outlines that provide a description of a testing approach for a software or hardware development cycle. It is a high- level document whose purpose is to inform project managers, test engineers and developers of some of the key issues associated with the testing process. These could include the testing objectives, methodologies of testing new functionality, details of the total testing time and the resource requirements for the testing environment or site. A typical test strategy document of a software company could include:  


Scope and Objectives Business issues Roles and responsibilities Communication and status reporting Test deliverability Industry standards to follow Test automation and tools Testing measurements and metrics Risks and mitigation Defect reporting and tracking Change and configuration management Training plan.

Test strategies describe how risks for the company associated with a product or system are reduced by conducting the tests. The documentation also describes which kind of tests will be performed and what entry/ exit criteria will apply (if this applicable to the product or software).  


Test strategies are created based on development design documentation and for every stage of development design, a corresponding test strategy should be created to test the new and adapted features.  


## Test plans  


Test plans are documents that detail the systematic approach to each phase or level of testing of a product or piece of software. The test plan documentation is usually written by the test manager and focuses on describing what to test, how to test, when to test and who will conduct which test; it is a detailed description of the eventual test workflow, together with the planned outcomes and associated expectations.  


Large test projects occasionally have one master test plan that is a common document for all the test phases.
