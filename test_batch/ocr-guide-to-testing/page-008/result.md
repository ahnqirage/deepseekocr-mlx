## Retesting  


## When a development team are satisfied that rectification process has been completed they will submit the application or product for retesting.  


Retesting could entail the submission of the application or artefact to the full range of original tests or maybe just a selection of the tests that the item originally failed. However, the same stringent recording and reporting procedures are still applied to any retests.  


## Regression testing  


Part of the process of retesting software may include 'regression testing'. This is a type of functional testing that seeks to uncover new issues, called 'regressions', in existing functionality after alterations have been made to an application or system such as functional enhancements, patches or configuration changes.  


The purpose of regression testing is to ensure that a change, such as the fixing of a bug, did not introduce new errors. One reason for carrying out regression testing is to investigate whether a modification in one part of a program has affected other parts of the software.  


Regression testing does not only test the 'correctness' of the program but is often used to track the quality of its output. For example, when designing a compiler, regression testing can be used to track the code size or the simulation time.  


Regression testing can be automated and there are a number of software tools available for this purpose such as 'Tinderbox', 'Hudson' and 'Jenkins'.  


Typical regression testing methods include re- running previously executed run tests and checking whether the software behaviour has altered and whether previously corrected bugs have reoccurred.  


Regression testing is an efficient method of testing an application or system due to the ability of the tester to systematically choose the appropriate minimum number of tests required to satisfactorily cover a particular modification.
