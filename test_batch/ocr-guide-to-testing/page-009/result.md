## When should testing take place?  


## For a generic product or software lifecycle, testing takes place during and between the development phase and the product or application launch.  


During the latter stages of the development phase, the person responsible for quality assurance (this could be an individual or a department, depending on the size of the organisation) prepares test plans and may also configure a test environment.  


Testing often happens on an iterative (repeated) basis with each iteration checking off issues identified in the previous round of testing, together with looking at new content or product.  


This happens alongside other functional groups that might prepare documentation to support customers, trainers and suppliers. Only when the required completed documentation has been compiled and signed off will the handover to testing occur.  


The testing of business IT systems could involve readiness tests that take place within a laboratory environment or IT department where controlled system or network operational tests may be performed to ensure operational readiness. Additionally, field tests may occur with small target groups of users within the actual business environment.
