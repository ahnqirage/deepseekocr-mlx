## Testing within Health & Social Care  


At first glance it would appear that testing within IT, business and industry would have little in common with testing procedures that are carried out within the Health & Social Care context and it is true that there are major differences however, look a little closer and there are similarities also.  


Whereas the purposes of testing within IT, business and industry are associated with products meeting specification criteria and minimising risk for product stakeholders, the purpose of testing within Health & Social Care is to measure various attributes of the body's systems to determine the overall health of the individual.  


The typical, non- invasive tests that a health and social care professional may carry out include the measurement of pulse rate, breathing rate, temperature and blood pressure. The resulting readings are then compared with expected standard values that have been confirmed and agreed by medical science. In a lot of respects this is similar to the manner in which industry compares captured test values to specification requirements agreed with between vendor and client.  


Additionally, just like a test engineer having knowledge of how adverse or extreme conditions can impact on product test values, so must the health professional have awareness of how certain physical and medical factors can affect the reliability of body system measurements.  


During performance tests, software or a product may be subjected to different conditions such as increasing the data rate, the speed of operation or the operating temperature. Similarly, the health professional must be aware of the differing behaviour of attributes such as pulse rate, breathing rate and blood pressure etc. during and recovering from exercise.  


There are also similarities between the professions in the manner in which captured test data maybe collated and presented by using csv. files, spreadsheets, graphs, tables and charts. Also, just like a test engineer might do a health professional maybe called upon to use gathered data to write a report to be submitted to a management team.
