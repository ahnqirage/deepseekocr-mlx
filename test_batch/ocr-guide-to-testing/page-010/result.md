# Who should undertake testing - in-house vs. external test houses?  


There is an ongoing debate regarding which is more advantageous, using in- house or external testing.  


In- house testing is when an organisation employs its own test engineers or programmers to test the products, systems or programs that it developers itself.  


External testing companies are companies whose main business focus is testing. These companies usually specialise in the testing for particular industries or products, for example aerospace, marine equipment, nuclear technology or software applications for different purposes.  


Below is a list of points that highlight the advantages of each of the approaches.

## The advantages of using in-house testing  


Although for a number of years it has become usual for companies to outsource testing recently, and as a result of companies wishing to cut costs, in- house testing has begun to become attractive once more. The advantages to in- house testing are:  


1. It is significantly cheaper than outsourcing testing to external testing organisations.  


2. Companies can employ people with skills additional to their testing expertise so that when they are not engaged in testing they can be utilised within other departments.  


3. In-house test engineers understand the product and there are no issues with regard to mis-communicating the details of complex products or systems, which can potentially put projects at risk.  


4. If the system is being developed for use within the business then in-house engineers will have a better knowledge and understanding of how people work within the organisation and will be aware of any potential issues within specific departments. They will also be able to organise targeted field testing more efficiently as a consequence of knowing which management personnel to approach.  


## The advantages of using external test houses  


There are a number of benefits to outsourcing product and software testing to external testing organisations. These are detailed below:  


1. The company can gain confidence in the knowledge that their product is being tested by certified, trained and experienced test engineers.  
2. Test companies usually have a great deal of expertise in automated testing which allows the repeated tests to be done quickly, accurately and efficiently.  
3. There is a minimum amount of time spent on specific knowledge transfer as the engineers derive their product understanding from the requirement documentation provided by the customer.  
4. As a consequence of their expertise in test data management the test data that is critical to replicating real-time scenarios becomes easily accessible.  
5. Testing companies apply robust, objective and procedural engineering approaches to software testing which offer confidence and efficiency.  
6. Testing houses usually have flexibility with regard to team size and so can increase or decrease numbers in accordance to customer requirements.  


7. Professional testing companies commonly have access to cutting-edge equipment and software.
