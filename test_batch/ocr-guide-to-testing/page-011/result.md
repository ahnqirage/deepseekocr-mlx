# Quality assurance methods  


## Quality assurance (QA) methods are defined as scheduled and systematic events implemented within a quality system to ensure that quality requirements for a product, application, system or service will be fulfilled.  


QA systems incorporate methods of consistent measurement, procedures to compare the resulting measurements with a standard, monitoring of processes and the inclusion of associated feedback loops, which prevents errors.  


Quality assurance should not be confused with quality control where the emphasis is on process outputs.  


The essence of quality assurance is basically two principles:  


'Fit for Purpose', which refers to the fact that the product, system or software should be suitable for its intended purpose and; 'Right First Time' which refers to the implementation of procedures with the sole purpose of eradicating mistakes.  


QA covers a wide range of aspects associated with the production of products, systems or applications including the management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies of components, production methods and services, management procedures and production and inspection processes.  


It should be understood that acceptable quality is decided upon by users or customers and not society in general. It is a common misconception that quality is linked to price or descriptions such as 'high' or 'low' quality.  


This is in fact untrue, for example a low- priced product may be regarded as having 'high' quality as a consequence of being biodegradable (for example these bowls https://www.biopak.com/uk/products/plates- bowls- trays/palm- leaf- tableware, whereas another could be considered as having 'low' quality because it too is biodegradable, such as the paper used to print most newspapers.

Quality assurance processes can take many forms and vary in scope and complexity. It is very common for standard QA processes to be modified to suit a specific production process. A typical quality assurance process may include:  


- the testing of previous products or systems- the creation of a plan to improve- the production of a design that includes improvements and requirements- the manufacturing with improvements- an evaluation of the new product or system with the improvements- the testing of the new product or system.
