## What is testing?  


## The purpose of testing is to make objective judgments about how well something meets, exceeds or fails to meet an identified set of criteria.  


You use testing when you want to understand and gain confidence that a product, system, process or device will perform well when it is eventually issued to customers and/or users.  


When you are involved in complex projects, such as software development or designing business systems, testing is important as it often identifies the end of the 'development' phase. It is also frequently used to establish the criteria on which a customer or end user will base their decision to either accept or refuse the project.  


## Definitions  


End User(s) - The person or persons that actually use a particular product or piece of software.  


Customer - A person or business that buys products or services. Customers can be end users however a business can purchase a product to include it, as a component, within one of its products to sell on to end users.  


## What are the purposes of testing?  


There are two basic purposes of testing:  


1. Testing checks that what has been produced and delivered is what was described in the specification agreed between the developer and the customer. It verifies that the system or product meets the performance, design, functional and implementation requirements identified within the specification.  
2. Testing also has the function of managing risk for both the customer and the supplier. In business, a testing program identifies whether a project has been completed to the satisfaction of both the customer and supplier so that the contract can be closed and paid for. It is at this point that the product or system moves into the 'maintenance' phase of the project life.  


## When should testing take place?  


If a generic product or software lifecycle is considered, testing commonly takes place between the 'development' phase and the product or application launch or handover (see the later section on when testing should take place for a more detailed explanation).
