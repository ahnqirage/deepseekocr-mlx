# Defining test criteria  


When creating a test plan, there is a range of different approaches that can be called upon for different testing situations however, in each scenario, specific criteria need to be defined and agreed between customer and supplier.  


## Pass/Fail Criteria  


When test engineers conduct tests on software code or a new business system, some aspects will pass and some will fail. The criteria for passing or failing need to be described in clear, unambiguous language and agreed with the customer. A procedure needs to be defined in advance of the tests to allow the engineers or test participants to log the problems they experience and other issues they believe need to be resolved.  


Pass/fail criteria are sometimes known as entry/exit or compliance criteria.  


Pass/fail test criteria is commonly used in the testing of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).  


## Acceptance Criteria  


Acceptance testing is a validation test that is conducted to determine if the requirements of a specific criteria or a whole contract has been met. The criteria by which acceptance testing is conducted need to be clearly defined and agreed between the customer and the supplier or developer. Additionally, the procedures by which the acceptance criteria are tested need to be defined and agreed, these may involve processes such as chemical tests, physical tests or performance tests.  


An example of a specific acceptance criterion within a software testing situation could be:  


A (named user role) can (select/operate) a (feature/ function) so that (output) is (visible/complete/etc.) This would lead to a yes/no decision for the user or developer.  


Within systems engineering, acceptance testing may involve 'black box testing' to be performed on a system, such as a piece of program code, a sub- assembly of manufactured components or chemical products prior to its delivery or commission. Black box testing is a functional test which is also known as application testing, confidence testing or quality assurance testing.  


## Alpha tests  


Alpha testing can either be simulated or actual operational testing by potential customers or by an outside independent testing company. This type of testing is often applied to off- the- shelf software or systems and is often used as a type of internal acceptance testing procedure, prior to the software being submitted for beta testing.  


## Beta tests  


Beta testing follows on from alpha testing and can be looked upon as a kind of external user acceptance testing. Software versions (known as beta versions) are released to a limited group of users outside of the development team. This further layer of testing ensures that when the new software is put on general release it has as few faults and bugs as possible.  


Beta versions are sometimes even released to selected members of the public who have an interest in using a new version but who are also willing to feedback to the organisation about issues and bugs they discover.  


An example of this could be the testing of a new version of an image- manipulation package. The alpha testing would be carried out at the software company's site until a level of performance is reached. Then, for a limited time the company will issue a release of the program to a select group of users for beta testing; this is the beta testing.  


Recently Adobe's Lightroom 4 has just come through a beta testing period and has now been released for sale. The beta testing versions no longer work on user tester's computers unless they buy a registration code and download an update.
