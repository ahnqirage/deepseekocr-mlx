## Recording test results  


As you can imagine there are many ways in which to record test results with a lot depending on the actual test being carried out.  


If an electrician needs to record the results of a compliance test of an electrical installation he can simply read the information displayed by the test equipment and record the results on a form manually which is then attached to a certification form.  


Often test analysis equipment used in industries such as engineering, chemical or mining industries, will record the test results electronically. The equipment can then be connected to computers and the results downloaded in the form of a .csv file and easily transformed into a spreadsheet.  


With regard to software testing, there are a wide variety of both open source and proprietary testing tools available for this purpose. These can be manually operated or automated. Obviously there are differences in the manner in which software testing tools work but they typically all follow a similar format. A defect tracking or debugging system within the programs uses facilities such as instruction set simulators, program animations or benchmarks to detect and record any errors or bugs it finds and documents what occurred, where within the code it occurred and a preliminary assessment of the severity of the error. The information is then transformed into measurements of different aspects of the software or its specification called 'metrics' (see below).  


In User Acceptance Testing of software, 'user stories' are written. These are one or more sentences that are written in the everyday or business- like language of the end user. A 'user story' captures the 'who', 'what' and 'why' of a requirement in a simple, concise way and is often limited in detail by what can be handwritten on a small paper notecard. They can be written by or for the business user as the primary way that they can influence the functionality of the system or application being developed. User stories may also be written by developers in order for them to convey non- functional requirements such as security features, performance or quality. Follow this link for examples of 'user stories' - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_ story#Examples.  


## What happens to the results?  


When software testing is completed, testers generate 'metrics', which are measurements of some property or aspect of a piece of software or its specifications. These could be bugs per line of code, program load time, number of lines of customer requirements or simply program size. These are then passed to the development team for them to decide what defects should be assigned, fixed, rejected or deferred to be dealt with later.  


An example of a test metrics document can be seen here: www.cyreath.co.uk/papers/Cyreath_Software_Test_Metrics.pdf  


With regard to the testing of the product, the most common procedure is for the test engineers who carry out the tests to gather the results and write a report summarising what errors or issues were discovered during the test. This is then passed to the development team who then decide the course of action to rectify the problems.
