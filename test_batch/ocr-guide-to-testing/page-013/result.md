## Conclusion  


## In summary the important points to remember about testing are:  


Testing is an important and crucial part of a product or software lifecycle that is purposefully scheduled within a defined place between the development stage and the product or application launch.- It is the stage in the process that verifies that a product or application meets performance, design, functional and implementation requirements identified within a specification that has been agreed between a supplier and a customer or end user.- Testing provides the confidence that a project has been completed to the satisfaction of both the customer and supplier so that the contract can be closed and paid for.- Testing is a formal QA process that can be carried out by expert, outside companies or in- house specialist departments. It consists of specific procedures described within test strategies and test plans that inform test engineers whether a product or a piece of software meets specific test criteria.  


It is important to incorporate both manual and automated procedures into test strategies in order to have the confidence that comprehensive testing has taken place.- There are a range of test criteria that exist for specific purposes including pass/fail criteria and acceptance criteria that involves alpha and beta testing procedures.- The results of testing inform the decisions that development personnel have to make regarding the production and the state of readiness of a product.- The process of recording and the presentation format of the test results is an important consideration for test engineers.
