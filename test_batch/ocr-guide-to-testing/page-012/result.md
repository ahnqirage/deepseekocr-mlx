## Ongoing testing  


Many software houses now use a post- release facility where, in the event of users encountering a bug or experience a crash, a window appears which invites the user to complete a bug report.  


## User feedback  


This is then sent to the company along with a file identifying which area of the program crashed and details of the crash. From this feedback the software house can understand whether there is a persistent problem and helps them to decide whether to issue a patch or an update.

## User experience programs  


A lot of software companies are now inviting new customers to be participants in a user experience program in exchange for gifts or free upgrades. When a user installs the new application it will ask them to register their purchase with the software company. Within this registration process, there will be an invitation to participate in the program and if the user agrees the company will periodically request feedback about their experience when using the program. Some companies even include a function within their programme's facilities where, with the user's permission, they can capture performance data direct from the software over the internet.  


## Ongoing reliability tests  


Ongoing reliability tests are hardware tests commonly associated with manufacturing to ensure that the quality of the products that are coming off the production line after a period of time after release are still of the same specifications as the early models manufactured soon after release.  


Products are sometimes placed in a 'burn- in' chamber that matches the upper limits of the specification temperature in order to bring the product to early maturity. The quality of the product is then measured and if the unit fails then an investigation proceeds to find out if parts bought from other manufacturers are the items that caused the failure. If this isn't the case then the whole batch of units that were produced at the same time as the failed unit are tagged for retesting or repair to either verify or correct the issue.
